The right to vote is the foundation of American democracy. However many Americans face significant obstacles in exercising this fundamental right. These obstacles range from lack of
election information to barriers at polling places.(1) The coronavirus pandemic further exacerbated these barriers.(2) According to the 2022 American National Election Studies (ANES)
Pilot Study, 69% of registered voters reported encountering some form of diﬀiculty while voting.(3) Furthermore, these challenges disproportionately affect certain groups, leading to voter
suppression and reduced turnout.(4)(5) Research shows that Democratic and Republican voters often face different voting diﬀiculties. Understanding these differences is critical because voting obstacles can influence voter participation and potentially alter election results. This analysis aims to address the following
research question:

**Do Democratic voters or Republican voters experience more diﬀiculty voting?**

We created this group analysis in hopes the answer could reveal disparities in the voting experience between these groups and highlight whether specific challenges disproportionately
impact one party. Identifying systemic biases or voter suppression linked to demographic and geographic factors can provide valuable insights for governments aiming to make voting more
accessible and fair. A better understanding of these challenges can help develop targeted initiatives to reduce obstacles, increase voter turnout, and ensure a more equitable voting process for everyone.

3: 69% is the percentage of registered voters based on the ‘reg’ variable that did not mark “vharder_12” or “none of these”, indicating they experienced some form of diﬀiculty (marked
at least one diﬀiculty out of variables “vharder_1-11”)
